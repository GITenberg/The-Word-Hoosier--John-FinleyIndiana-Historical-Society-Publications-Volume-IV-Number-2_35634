    <p>During the period of about three-quarters of a century in which the State of
    Indiana and its people have been designated by the word "Hoosier," there has been a
    large amount of discussion of the origin and meaning of the term, but with a notable
    lack of any satisfactory result. Some of these discussions have been almost wholly
    conjectural in character, but others have been more methodical, and of the latter the
    latest and most exhaustive&mdash;that of Mr. Meredith Nicholson<a name="FNanchor_1_1"
    id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
    &mdash;sums up the results in the statement "The origin of the term 'Hoosier' is not
    known with certainty." Indeed the statement might properly have been made much
    broader, for a consideration of the various theories offered leaves the unprejudiced
    investigator with the feeling that the real solution of the problem has not even been
    suggested. This lack of satisfactory conclusions, however, may be of some value, for
    it strongly suggests the probability that the various theorists have made some false
    assumption of fact, and have thus been thrown on a false scent, at the very beginning
    of their investigations.</p>

    <p>As is natural in such a case, there has been much of assertion of what was merely
    conjectural, often accompanied by the pioneer's effort to make evidence of his theory
    by the statement that he was "in Indiana at the time and knows the facts." The
    acceptance of all such testimony would necessarily lead to the adoption of several
    conflicting conclusions. In addition to this cause of error, there have crept into
    the discussion several misstatements of fact that have been commonly adopted, and it
    is evident that in order to reach any reliable conclusion now, it will be necessary
    to examine the facts critically and ascertain what are tenable.</p>

    <p>The traditional belief in Indiana is that the word was first put in <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>print by John Finley, in his
    poem "The Hoosiers Nest," and this is noted by Berry Sulgrove, who was certainly as
    well acquainted with Indiana tradition as any man of his time.<a name="FNanchor_2_1"
    id="FNanchor_2_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
    This belief is at least probably well founded, for up to the present time no prior
    use of the word in print has been discovered. This poem attracted much attention at
    the time, and was unquestionably the chief cause of the widespread adoption of the
    word in its application to Indiana, for which reasons it becomes a natural
    starting-point in the inquiry.</p>

    <p>It is stated by Oliver H. Smith that this poem originally appeared as a New Year's
    "carriers' address" of the Indianapolis Journal in 1830,<a name="FNanchor_3_1" id=
    "FNanchor_3_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and
    this statement has commonly been followed by other writers, but this is clearly
    erroneous, as any one may see by inspection of the files of the Journal, for it
    printed its address in the body of the paper in 1830, and it is a totally different
    production. After that year it discontinued this practice and issued its addresses on
    separate sheets, as is commonly done at present. No printed copy of the original
    publication is in existence, so far as known, but Mr. Finley's daughter&mdash;Mrs.
    Sarah Wrigley, former librarian of the Morrison Library, at Richmond,
    Indiana&mdash;has a manuscript copy, in the author's handwriting, which fixes the
    date of publication as Jan. 1, 1833. There is no reason to question this date,
    although Mr. Finley states in his little volume of poems printed in 1860, that this
    poem was written in 1830. The poem as it originally appeared was never reprinted in
    full, so far as is known, and in that form it is entirely unknown to the present
    generation, although it has been reproduced in several forms, and in two of them by
    direct authority of the author.<a name="FNanchor_4_1" id="FNanchor_4_1"></a><a href=
    "#Footnote_4_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The author used his privilege of
    revising his work, and while he may have improved his poetry, he seriously marred its
    historical value.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

    <p>As the manuscript copy is presumably a literal transcript of the original
    publication, with possibly the exception that the title may have been added at a
    later date, I reproduce it here in full:</p>

      <p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Compelled to seek the Muse's aid,</span><br/>
      Your carrier feels almost dismay'd<br/>

      Aware how very few excel<br />
      In the fair art he loves so well,<br/>
      And that the wight who would pursue it<br />
      Must give his whole attention to it;<br/>
      But, ever as his mind delights<br />
      To follow fancy's airy flights<br />
      Some object of terrestrial mien<br />
      Uncourteously obtrudes between<br />
      And rudely scatters to the winds<br />
      The tangled threads of thought he spins;<br/>
      His wayward, wild imagination<br />
      Seeks objects of its own creation<br />
      Where Joy and Pleasure, hand in hand,<br/>
      Escort him over "Fairyland,"<br/>
      Till some imperious earth-born care<br />

      So, lest my friends be led to doubt it,<br/>

      He fed him in a sugar trough.<br/>
      The stranger stooped to enter in,<br/>
      The entrance closing with a pin,<br/>
      And manifested strong desire<br />
      To seat him by the log heap fire,<br/>
      Where half a dozen Hoosheroons,<br/>
      With mush and milk, tincups and spoons,<br/>
      White heads, bare feet and dirty faces,<br/>
      Seemed much inclined to keep their places,<br/>

      Her offspring to the ladder led<br />
      And cuffed the youngsters up to bed.<br/>
      Invited shortly to partake<br />

      One side was lined with skins of "varments"<br/>

      Where venison hams in plenty hung,<br/>
      Two rifles placed above the door,<br/>

    <p>It will be noted that throughout the manuscript the word is spelled "Hoosher" and
    is always put in quotation marks. Mrs. Wrigley informs me that her father had no
    knowledge of the origin of the word, but found it in verbal use when he wrote. She is
    confident, however, that he coined the word "hoosheroon," and the probability of this
    is increased by the fact that he did not quote it in his manuscript. In later
    editions of the poem he used the form "Hoosier." His original spelling shows that the
    word was not common in print, and several years passed before the spelling became
    fixed in its present form.</p>

    <p>Although the word "Hoosier" has not been found in print earlier than January 1,
    1833, it became common enough immediately afterwards. In fact the term seems to have
    met general approval, and to have been accepted by everybody. On January 8, 1833, at
    the Jackson dinner at Indianapolis, John W. Davis gave the toast, "The Hooshier State
    of Indiana."<a name="FNanchor_5_1" id="FNanchor_5_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1"
    class="fnanchor"><sup>[5]</sup></a> On August 3, 1833, the Indiana Democrat published
    the following prospectus of a new paper to be established by ex-Gov. Ray and
    partner:</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="big">PROSPECTUS</span><br/>

    FOR PUBLISHING<br/>

    <span class="huge">THE HOOSIER</span><br/>

     <span class="big">AT GREENCASTLE, INDIANA,</span><br/>

    <span class="big">BY J. B. RAY &amp; W. M. TANNEHILL.</span></p>

      <p class="blockquot">We intend publishing a real <i>Newspaper</i>. To this promise, (though
      comprehensive enough) we would add, that it is intended<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> to make the <i>moral</i>
      and political world contribute their full share, in enriching its columns.</p>

      <p class="blockquot">The arts and sciences, and agriculture and commerce, and literature shall all
      receive a due portion of our care.</p>

      <p class="blockquot">Left to our choice we might refrain from remark on presidential matters; but
      supposing, that you may require an intimation, suffice it to say, that our past
      preference has been for General Jackson and his administration; and we deem it
      premature to decide as to the future without knowing who are to be the candidates.
      Those men who shall sustain <i>Western measures</i>, shall be our men. Believing
      that there is but <i>one</i> interest in the <i>West</i>, and but little occasion
      for partyism beyond the investigation of principles and the conduct of
      functionaries, we would rather encourage <i>union</i> than excite <i>division</i>.
      We shall constantly keep in view the happiness, interest and prosperity of
      <i>all</i>. To the <i>good</i>, this paper will be as a shield; to the <i>bad</i>,
      a terror.</p>

      <p class="blockquot">The Hoosier will be published weekly, at $2 in advance and 25 cents for every
      three months delay of payment, per annum, on a good sheet of paper of superroyal
      size, to be enlarged to an imperial as the subscription will justify it.</p>

      <p class="blockquot">This paper shall do honor to the people of Putnam county; and we expect to see
      them patronize us. The press is now at Greencastle. Let subscription papers be
      returned by the 1st of Sept. when the first number will appear.</p>

    <p>On Oct. 26, 1833 the Indiana Democrat republished from the Cincinnati Republican a
    discussion of the origin and making of the word "Hoosier," which will be quoted in
    full hereafter, which shows that the term had then obtained general adoption. C. F.
    Hoffman, a traveler who passed through the northern part of the state, says, under
    date of Dec. 29, 1833:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">I am now in the land of the <i>Hooshiers</i>, and find that long-haired race
      much more civilized than some of their Western neighbors are willing to represent
      them. The term "Hooshier," like that of Yankee, or Buckeye, first applied
      contemptuously, has now become a <i>soubriquet</i> that bears nothing invidious
      with it to the ear of an Indianian.
      <a name="FNanchor_6_1" id="FNanchor_6_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>


    <p>On Jan. 4, 1834, the Indiana Democrat quoted from the Maysville, Ky., Monitor,
    "The <i>Hoosier</i> State like true democrats have taken the lead in appointing
    delegates to a National Convention etc." On May 10, 1834, the Indianapolis Journal
    printed the following editorial paragraph:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">The Hooshier, started some time ago by Messrs. Ray and Tannehill, at
      Greencastle, has sunk into repose; and a new paper<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> entitled the "Greencastle Advertiser,"
      published by James M. Grooms, has taken its place.</p>

    <p>It is quite possible that this statement was made with the mischievous intent of
    stirring up Gov. Ray, for he was rather sensitive, and the Whigs seemed to delight in
    starting stories that called forth indignant denials from him. If this was the
    purpose it was successful, for on May 31 the Journal said:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">We understand that another No. of the Hooshier has been recently received in
      town, and that it contains quite a bitter complaint about our remark a week or two
      ago, that it had "sunk into repose." We assure the Editor that we made the remark
      as a mere matter of news, without any intention to rejoice at the suspension of the
      paper. Several weeks had passed over without any paper being received, and it was
      currently reported that it had "blowed out" and therefore, as a mere passing
      remark, we stated that it had "sunk into repose." We have no objection that it
      should live a thousand years.</p>

    <p>The new paper, however, did not last as long as that. It was sold in the fall of
    1834 to J. W. Osborn who continued the publication, but changed the name, in the
    following spring, to the "Western Plough Boy." On Sept. 19, 1834, the Indiana
    Democrat had the following reference to Mr. Finley:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">The poet <i>laureat</i> of Hoosierland and editor of the Richmond Palladium has
      threatened to cut acquaintance with B. of the Democrat!! The gentleman alluded to
      is the same individual that was unceremoniously robbed, by the Cincinnati
      Chronicle, of the credit of immortalizing our State in verse, by that justly
      celebrated epic of the "Hoosier's Nest."</p>

    <p>On Nov. 29. 1834, the Vincennes Sun used the caption, "Hoosier and Mammoth
    Pumpkins," over an article reprinted from the Cincinnati Mirror concerning a load of
    big pumpkins from Indiana.</p>

    <p>These extracts sufficiently demonstrate the general acceptation of the name in the
    two years following the publication of Finley's poem. The diversified spelling of the
    word at this period shows that it was new in print, and indeed some years elapsed
    before the now accepted spelling became universal. On Jan. 6, 1838 the Ft. Wayne
    Sentinel, republished the portion of the poem beginning with the words,
    "Blest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
    Indiana, in her soil." It was very probable that this publication was made directly
    from an original copy of the carrier's address, for Thomas Tigar, one of the founders
    and editors of the Ft. Wayne Sentinel, had been connected with the Indianapolis press
    in January 1833, and the old-fashioned newspaperman was accustomed to preserve
    articles that struck his fancy, and reproduce them. In this publication the poem is
    given as in the Finley manuscript, except that the first two times the word occurs it
    is spelled "hoosier" and once afterward "hoosheer," the latter evidently a
    typograpical error. At the other points it is spelled "hoosher." This original form
    of the word also indicates that there has been some change in the pronunciation, and
    this is confirmed from another source. For many years there have been perodical
    discussions of the origin of the word in the newspapers of the State, and in one of
    these, which occurred in the Indianapolis Journal, in 1860, when numerous
    contemporaries of Finley were still living, Hon. Jere Smith, a prominent citizen of
    Winchester, made this statement:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">My recollection is that the word began to be used in this country in the fall of
      1824, but it might have been as late as 1826 or 1827, when the Louisville &amp;
      Portland canal was being made. I first heard it at a corn-husking. It was used in
      the sense of "rip-roaring," "half horse" and "half alligator," and such like
      backwoods coinages. It was then, and for some years afterwards, spoken as if
      spelled "husher," the "u" having the sound it has in "bush," "push," etc. In 1829,
      1830 and 1831 its sound glided into "hoosher," till finally Mr. Finley's "Hoosier's
      Nest" made the present orthography and pronunciation classical, and it has remained
      so since.<a name="FNanchor_7_1" id="FNanchor_7_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1"
      class="fnanchor"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

    <p>Of course, this is not conclusive evidence that there was a change in
    pronunciation, for Mr. Smith's observation may have extended to one neighborhood
    only, and it may have taken on a variant pronunciation at the start, but his
    testimony, in connection with the changed spelling, is certainly very plausible.</p>

    <p>There have been offered a number of explanations of the<span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> origin of the word, and
    naturally those most commonly heard are those that have been most extensively
    presented in print. Of the "authorities" on the subject perhaps the best known is
    Bartlett "Dictionary of Americanism's" which was originally published in 1838 and was
    widely circulated in that and the subsequent edition, besides being frequently
    quoted. Its statement is as follows:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">Hoosier. A nickname given at the West, to natives of Indiana.<br/></p>

      <p class="blockquot">A correspondent of the Providence Journal, writing from Indiana, gives the
      following account of the origin of this term:<br/></p>
      <p class="blockquot2">Throughout all the early Western
      settlements were men who rejoiced in their physical strength, and on numerous
      occasions, at log-rollings and house-raisings, demonstrated this to their entire
      satisfaction. They were styled by their fellow-citizens, hushers, from their
      primary capacity to still their opponents. It was a common term for a bully
      throughout the West. The boatmen of Indiana were formerly as rude and primitive a
      set as could well belong to a civilized country, and they were often in the habit
      of displaying their pugilistic accomplishments upon the levee at New Orleans. Upon
      a certain occasion there one of these rustic professors of the "noble art" very
      adroitly and successfully practiced the "fancy" upon several individuals at one
      time. Being himself not a native of the Western world, in the exuberance of his
      exultation he sprang up, exclaiming, in a foreign accent, "I'm a hoosier, I'm a
      hoosier." Some of the New Orleans papers reported the case, and afterwards
      transferred the corruption of the word "husher" (hoosier) to all the boatmen from
      Indiana, and from thence to all her citizens. The Kentuckians, on the contrary,
      maintained that the nickname expresses the gruff exclamation of their neighbors,
      when one knocks at a door, etc., "Who's yere?"</p>

    <p>Both of these theories have had adherents, and especially the latter, though
    nobody has ever found any basis for their historical features beyond the assertion of
    this newspaper correspondent. Nobody has ever produced any evidence of the use of the
    word "husher" as here indicated. It is not found in any dictionary of any
    kind&mdash;not even in Bartlett's. I have never found any indication of its former
    use or its present survival. And there is no greater evidence of the use of the
    expression "Who's yere?" when approaching a house. As a matter of fact, the common
    custom when coming to a house and desiring communication with the residents was to
    call,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> "Hallo
    the house!" And this custom is referred to in Finley's line:</p>

    <p class="blockquot">He hailed the house, and then alighted.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, if a person who came to a house called "Who's yere?" what cause would
    there be for calling the people who lived in the house "who's yeres?" There is
    neither evidence nor reason to support it. But there is still a stronger reason for
    discarding these theories, and most others. To produce the change of a word or term
    by corruption, there must be practical identity of sound and accent. It was natural
    enough for the Indiana pioneers to convert "au poste" into "Opost." It was natural
    enough for the New Mexican settlers to change "Jicarilla" to "Hickory." It was
    natural enough for the Colorado cowboys to transform "Purgatoire river" to
    "Picketwire river." But there is scant possibility of changing "husher," or "who's
    yere"&mdash;as it would probably be spoken&mdash;into "hoosh-er." This consideration
    has led to the suggestion that the expression from which the word came was "who is
    yer?" but there is nothing to support this. The early settlers did not use "is" for
    "are" but usually pronounced the latter "air." And they did not say "yer" for "you,"
    though they often used it for "your."</p>

    <p>Another theory, almost as popular as these, derives the word from "hussar," and
    this theory, in its various forms, harks back to a Col. John Jacob Lehmanowsky, who
    served under Napoleon, and afterwards settled in Indiana, where he became widely
    known as a lecturer on the Napoleonic wars. The tradition preserved in his family is
    that once while in Kentucky he became engaged in a dispute with some natives, and
    sought to settle the matter by announcing that he was a hussar. They understood him
    to say that he was a "hoosier," and thereafter applied that name to everybody from
    Indiana. This theory has several shapes, one being presented by the Rev. Aaron Wood,
    the pioneer preacher, thus:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">The name "hoosier" originated as follows: When the young men of the Indiana side
      of the Ohio river went to Louisville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id=
      "Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> the Kentucky men boasted over them, calling them "New
      Purchase Greenies," claiming to be a superior race, composed of half horse, half
      alligator, and tipped off with snapping turtle. These taunts produced fights in the
      market house and streets of Louisville. On one occasion a stout bully from Indiana
      was victor in a fist fight, and having heard Colonel Lehmanowsky lecture on the
      "Wars of Europe," who always gave martial prowess to the German Hussars in a fight,
      pronouncing hussars "hoosiers" the Indianian, when the Kentuckian cried "enough,"
      jumped up and said: "I am a Hoosier," and hence the Indianians were called by that
      name. This was its true origin. I was in the State when it occured.<a name=
      "FNanchor_8_1" id="FNanchor_8_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1" class=
      "fnanchor"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, others are equally positive as to their "true origins." The chief
    objection that has been urged to this theory is that Lehmanowsky was not in the State
    when the term began to be used, and the evidence on this point is not very
    satisfactory. His son, M. L. Lehmanowsky, of DePauw, Ind., informs me that his father
    came to this country in 1815, but he is unable to fix the date of his removal to
    Indiana. Published sketches of his life
    <a name="FNanchor_9_1" id="FNanchor_9_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[9]</sup></a> state that he was with
    Napoleon at Waterloo; that he was afterwards imprisoned at Paris; that he escaped and
    made his way to New York; that he remained for several years at New York and
    Philadelphia where he taught school; that he came to Rush county, Indiana, and there
    married and bought a farm; that after bearing him seven children his wife died; that
    he then removed to Harrison county, arriving there in 1837. These data would indicate
    that he came to Indiana sometime before 1830. The date of the deed to his farm, as
    shown by the Rush county records, is April 30, 1835. Aside from the question of date,
    it is not credible that a Polish officer pronounced "hussar" "hoosier," or that from
    the use of that word by a known foreigner a new term could spring into existence, and
    so quickly be applied to the natives of the State where he chanced to live.</p>

    <p>To these theories of the origin of the word may be added one communicated to me by
    James Whitcomb Riley, whose <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg
    15]</a></span>acquaintance with dialect makes him an authority on the subject. It is evidently
    of later origin than the others, and not so well known to the public. A casual
    conversation happening to turn to this subject, he said: "These stories commonly told
    about the origin of the word 'Hoosier' are all nonsense. The real origin is found in
    the pugnacious habits of the early settlers. They were very vicious fighters, and not
    only gouged and scratched, but frequently bit off noses and ears. This was so
    ordinary an affair that a settler coming into a bar room on a morning after a fight,
    and seeing an ear on the floor, would merely push it aside with his foot and
    carelessly ask, 'Who's year'?" I feel safe in venturing the opinion that this theory
    is quite as plausible, and almost as well sustained by historical evidence, as any of
    the others.</p>

    <p>In this connection it is of interest to note the earliest known discussion of the
    meaning of the word, which has been referred to as republished in the Indiana
    Democrat of Oct. 26, 1833. It is as follows:</p>

      <p class="center"><span class="big">HOOSHIER.</span></p>

      <p class="blockquot">The appellation of Hooshier has been used in many of the Western States, for
      several years, to designate, in a good natural way, an inhabitant of our sister
      state of Indiana. Ex-Governor Ray has lately started a newspaper in Indiana, which
      he names "The Hoshier" (sic). Many of our ingenious native philologists have
      attempted, though very unsatisfactorily, to explain this somewhat singular term.
      Mordecai M. Noah, in the late number of his Evening Star, undertakes to account for
      it upon the faith of a rather apocryphal story of a recruiting officer, who was
      engaged during the last war, in enlisting a company of HUSSARS, whom by mistake he
      unfortunately denominated Hooshiers. Another etymologist tells us that when the
      state of Indiana was being surveyed, the surveyors, on finding the residence of a
      squatter, would exclaim "<i>Who's here</i>,"&mdash;that this exclamation,
      abbreviated to <i>Hooshier</i> was, in process of time, applied as a distinctive
      appellation to the original settlers of that state, and, finally to its inhabitants
      generally. Neither of these hypotheses are deserving any attention. The word
      Hooshier is indebted for its existence to that once numerous and unique, but now
      extinct class of mortals called the Ohio Boatmen.&mdash;In its original acceptation
      it was equivalent to "Ripstaver," "Scrouger," "Screamer," "Bulger,"
      "Ring-tailroarer," and a hundred others, equally expressive, but<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> which have never
      attained to such a respectable standing as itself. By some caprice which can never
      be explained, the appellation Hooshier became confined solely to such boatmen as
      had their homes upon the Indiana shore, and from them it was gradually applied to
      all the Indianians, who acknowledge it as good naturedly as the appellation of
      Yankee&mdash;Whatever may have been the original acceptation of Hooshier this we
      know, that the people to whom it is now applied, are amongst the bravest, most
      intelligent, most enterprising, most magnanimous, and most democratic of the Great
      West, and should we ever feel disposed to quit the state in which we are now
      sojourning, our own noble Ohio, it will be to enroll ourselves as adopted citizens
      in the land of the "HOOSHIER."&mdash;Cincinnati Republican.</p>

    <p>Here is a presentation of the question, ten months after Finley's publication,
    covering most of the ground that has since been occupied. The "hussar" theory is
    carried back to the war of 1812, long before Col. Lehmanowsky was in this country.
    The "who's here" theory is carried back to the government surveys, although it is
    certain that there were few, if any, "squatters" on government lands in Indiana
    before the surveys were made. The "husher" theory, in embryo, is presented in the
    writers theory, which is apparently conjectural, except perhaps as evidence that the
    word was applied to the rather rough-looking class of flat-boatmen who made their
    trips down the Ohio and Mississippi.</p>

    <p>There has been notable tendency to locate these stories at Louisville, and to
    connect them with the building of the Louisville and Portland canal which was under
    construction from 1826 to 1831, inclusive. The "husher" story is located there by
    several of its advocates. Another story, of recent origin, coming from one
    Vanblaricum, was recounted by Mr. George Cottman in the Indianapolis Press of
    February 6, 1901. Vanblaricum claimed that while passing through southern Tennessee
    he met a man named Hoosier, and this man said that a member of his family had a
    contract on the construction of the Louisville and Portland canal; that he employed
    his laborers from the Indiana side, and the neighbors got to calling them "Hoosier's
    men," from which the name "Hoosier" came to be applied to Indiana men
    generally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
    Vanblaricum could not give the address of his informant, or any information tending
    to confirm the story. At my request Mr. Louis Ludlow, Washington correspondent of the
    Indianapolis Sentinel, made inquiry of the representatives from the southern
    districts of Tennessee, and learned that none of them had ever heard of such a story,
    or knew of the name "Hoosier" in his district. An examination of the directories of
    Atlanta, Augusta, Baltimore, Chattanooga, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Little Rock,
    Louisville, Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, St.
    Joseph, Savannah, Wheeling, Wilmington, the District of Columbia, and the state of
    Tennessee, failed to reveal any such name as Hoosier. As it is hardly possible for a
    family name to disappear completely, we may reasonably drop the Vanblaricum story
    from consideration. The same conclusion will also apply to the story of a Louisville
    baker, named Hoosier, from whom the term is sometimes said to have come. It is now
    known that the occurrence of "Hoosier" as a Christian name in the minutes of an early
    Methodist conference in Indiana, was the result of misspelling. The members name was
    "Ho-si-er (accent on the second syllable) J. Durbin," and the secretary in writing it
    put in an extra "o." It may be mentioned in this connection that "Hooser" is a rather
    common family name in the South, and that "Hoos" is occasionally found.</p>

    <p>One of the most interesting wild-goose chases I ever indulged in was occasioned by
    a passage in the narrative of Francis and Theresa Pulszky, entitled "White, Red and
    Black." The Pulskys accompanied Kossuth on his trip through the States and visited
    Indianapolis in 1852. In the account of this visit Mrs. Pulszky says:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">Governor Wright is a type of the Hoosiers, and justly proud to be one of them. I
      asked him wherefrom his people had got this name. He told me that "Hoosa" is the
      Indian name for maize, the principal produce of the State.</p>

    <p>This opened a new vista. The names "Coosa" and "Tallapoosa" came to memory. How
    simple! The Indiana flatboatmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id=
    "Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> taking their loads of corn down the river were called
    "Hoosa men" by the Southern Indians, and so the name originated. But a search of
    Indian vocabularies showed no such name for maize or for anything else. The nearest
    approaches to it are "Hoosac" and "Housatonic," which are both probably corruptions
    from the same stem, "awass," meaning beyond or further. The latter word is supposed
    to be the Indian "wassatinak," which is the New England form of the Algonquin
    "awassadinang," meaning beyond the mountains.</p>

    <p>In 1854 Amelia M. Murray visited Indianapolis, and was for a time the guest of
    Governor Wright. In her book entitled "Letters from the United States, Cuba and
    Canada" (page 324), she says:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">Madame Pfeiffer (she evidently meant Mrs. Pulszky, for Madame Pfeiffer did not
      come here and does not mention the subject) mistook Governor Wright, when she gave
      from his authority another derivation for the word "Hoosier." It originated in a
      settler's exclaiming "Huzza," upon gaining the victory over a marauding party from
      a neighboring State.</p>

    <p>With these conflicting statements, I called on Mr. John C. Wright, son of Governor
    Wright. He remembered the visits of the Pulszkys and Miss Murray, but knew nothing of
    Madame Pfeiffer. He said: "I often heard my father discuss this subject. His theory
    was that the Indiana flatboatmen were athletic and pugnacious, and were accustomed,
    when on the levees of the Southern cities, to 'jump up and crack their heels
    together' and shout 'Huzza,' whence the name of 'huzza fellows.' We have the same
    idea now in 'hoorah people,' or 'a hoorah time.'"</p>

    <p>It will be noted that all these theories practically carry three features in
    common:</p>

    <p>1. They are alike in the idea that the word was first applied to a rough,
    boisterous, uncouth, illiterate class of people, and that the word originally implied
    this character.</p>

    <p>2. They are alike in the idea that the word came from the South, or was first
    applied by Southern people.</p>

    <p>3. They are alike in the idea that the word was coined for<span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> the purpose of
    designating Indiana people, and was not in existence before it was applied to
    them.</p>

    <p>If our primary suspicion be correct, that all the investigators and theorists have
    followed some false lead from the beginning, it will presumably be found in one of
    these three common features. Of the three, the one that would more probably have been
    derived from assumption than from observation is the third. If we adopt the
    hypothesis that it is erroneous, we have left the proposition that the word
    "hoosier," was in use at the South, signifying a rough or uncouth person, before it
    was applied to Indiana; and if this were true it would presumably continue to be used
    there in that sense. Now this condition actually exists, as appears from the
    following evidence.</p>

    <p>In her recent novel, "In Connection with the De Willoughby Claim," Mrs. Frances
    Hodgson Burnett refers several times to one of her characters&mdash;a boy from North
    Carolina&mdash;as a "hoosier." In reply to an inquiry she writes to me:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">The word "hoosier" in Tennessee and North Carolina seems to imply, as you
      suggest, an uncouth sort of rustic. In the days when I first heard it my idea was
      also that&mdash;in agreement with you again&mdash;it was a slang term. I think a
      Tennesseean or Carolinian of the class given to colloquialisms would have applied
      the term "hoosier" to any rustic person without reference to his belonging to any
      locality in particular. But when I lived in Tennessee I was very young and did not
      inquire closely into the matter.</p>

    <p>Mrs. C. W. Bean, of Washington, Ind., furnishes me this statement:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">In the year 1888, as a child, I visited Nashville, Tenn. One day I was walking
      down the street with two of my aunts, and our attention was attracted by a large
      number of mountaineers on the streets, mostly from northern Georgia, who had come
      in to some sort of society meeting. One of my aunts said, "What a lot of hoosiers
      there are in town." In surprise I said, "Why I am a Hoosier." A horrified look came
      over my aunt's face and she exclaimed, "For the Lord's sake, child, don't let any
      one here know you're a hoosier." I did not make the claim again for<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> on inspection the
      visitors proved a wild-looking lot who might be suspected of never having seen
      civilization before.</p>

    <p>Miss Mary E. Johnson, of Nashville, Tenn., gives the following statement:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">I have been familiar with the use of the word "hoosier" all my life, and always
      as meaning a rough class of country people. The idea attached to it, as I
      understand it, is not so much that they are from the country, as that they are
      green and gawky. I think the sense is much the same as in "hayseed," "jay" or
      "yahoo."</p>

    <p>Hon. Thetus W. Sims, Representative in Congress from the Tenth Tennessee district,
    says:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">I have heard all my life of the word "hoosier" as applied to an ignorant, rough,
      unpolished fellow.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Samuel M. Deal (formerly Miss Mary L. Davis of Indianapolis) gives me this
    statement:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">While visiting Columbia, S. C., I was walking one day with a young gentleman,
      and we passed a rough looking countryman, "My! what a hoosier," exclaimed my
      escort. "That is a very noble term to apply to such an object," I said. "Why so,"
      he inquired. "Why I am a Hoosier&mdash;all Indiana people are," I answered. "Oh! we
      do not use it in that sense here," he rejoined. "With us a hoosier means a
      jay."</p>

    <p>The following three statements were furnished to me by Mr. Meredith Nicholson, who
    collected them some months since:</p>

    <p>John Bell Henneman, of the department of English, University of Tennessee,
    Knoxville, writes:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">The word "hoosier" is generally used in Virginia, South Carolina, Tennessee as
      an equivalent for "a country hoodlum," "a rough, uncouth countryman," etc. The idea
      of "country" is always attached to it in my mind, with a degree of "uncouthness"
      added. I simply speak from my general understanding of the term as heard used in
      the States mentioned above.</p>

    <p>Mr. Raymond Weeks, of Columbia, Mo., writes:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">Pardon my delay in answering your question concerning the word "hoosier" in this
      section. The word means a native of Indiana, and has a rare popular sense of a
      backwoodsman, a rustic. One hears: "He is a regular hoosier."</p>

    <p>Mrs. John M. Judah, of Memphis, writes:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">About the word "Hoosier"&mdash;one hears it in Tennessee often. It always means
      rough, uncouth, countrified. "I am a Hoosier," I have said, and my friends answer
      bewilderingly, "But all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg
      21]</a></span> Indiana-born are Hoosiers," I declare, "What nonsense!" is the
      answer generally, but one old politician responded with a little more intelligence
      on the subject: "You Indianians should forget that. It has been untrue for many
      years." In one of Mrs. Evans's novels&mdash;"St. Elmo," I think&mdash;a noble
      philanthropic young Southern woman is reproached by her haughty father for teaching
      the poor children in the neighborhood&mdash;"a lot of hoosiers," he calls them. I
      have seen it in other books, too, but I can not recall them. In newspapers the word
      is common enough, in the sense I referred to.</p>

    <p>It is scarcely possible that this widespread use of the word in this general sense
    could have resulted if the word had been coined to signify a native of Indiana, but
    it would have been natural enough, if the word were in common use as slang in the
    South, to apply it to the people of Indiana. Many of the early settlers were of a
    rough and ready character, and doubtless most of them looked it in their long and
    toilsome emigration, but, more than that, it is an historical fact that about the
    time of the publication of Finley's poem there was a great fad of nicknaming in the
    West, and especially as to the several States. It was a feature of the humor of the
    day, and all genial spirits "pushed it along." A good illustration of this is seen in
    the following passage from Hoffman's "Winter in the West"<a name="FNanchor_10_1" id=
    "FNanchor_10_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
    referred to above:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">There was a long-haired "hooshier" from Indiana, a couple of smart-looking
      "suckers" from the southern part of Illinois, a keen-eyed, leather-belted "badger"
      from the mines of Ouisconsin, and a sturdy, yoemanlike fellow, whose white capot,
      Indian moccasins and red sash proclaimed, while he boasted a three years'
      residence, the genuine "wolverine," or naturalized Michiganian. Could one refuse to
      drink with such a company? The spokesman was evidently a "red horse" from Kentucky,
      and nothing was wanting but a "buckeye" from Ohio to render the assemblage as
      complete as it was select.</p>

    <p>This same frontier jocularity furnishes an explanation for the origin of several
    of the theories of the derivation of the name. If an assuming sort of person, in a
    crowd accustomed to the use of "hoosier" in its general slang sense, should
    pretentiously announce that he was a "husher," or a<span class="pagenum"><a name=
    "Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> "hussar," nothing would be more
    characteristically American than for somebody to observe, "He is a hoosier, sure
    enough." And the victim of the little pleasantry would naturally suppose that the
    joker had made a mistake in the term. But the significance of the word must have been
    quite generally understood, for the testimony is uniform that it carried its slurring
    significance from the start. Still it was not materially more objectionable than the
    names applied to the people of other States, and it was commonly accepted in the
    spirit of humor. As Mr. Finley put it, in later forms of his poem:</p>

      <p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">With feelings proud we contemplate</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rising glory of our State;</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor take offense by application</span><br/>
      Of its good-natured appellation.</p>

    <p>It appears that the word was not generally known throughout the State until after
    the publication of "The Hoosiers' Nest," though it was known earlier in some
    localities, and these localities were points of contact with the Southern people. And
    this was true as to Mr. Finley's locality, for the upper part of the Whitewater
    valley was largely settled by Southerners, and from the Tennessee-Carolina mountain
    region, where the word was especially in use. Such settlements had a certain
    individuality. In his "Sketches" (page 38) the Rev. Aaron Wood says:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">Previous to 1830 society was not homogeneous, but in scraps, made so by the
      electic affinity of race, tastes, sects and interest. There was a wide difference
      in the domestic habits of the families peculiar to the provincial gossip, dialect
      and tastes of the older States from which they had emigrated.</p>

    <p>The tradition in my own family, which was located in the lower part of the
    Whitewater valley, is that the word was not heard there until "along in the
    thirties." In that region it always carried the idea of roughness or uncouthness, and
    it developed a derivative&mdash;"hoosiery"&mdash;which was used as an adjective or
    adverb to indicate something that was rough, awkward or shiftless. Testimony as to a
    similar condition in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg
    23]</a></span> the middle part of the Whitewater valley is furnished in the following
    statement, given me by the Rev. T. A. Goodwin:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">In the summer of 1830 I went with my father, Samuel Goodwin, from our home at
      Brookville to Cincinnati. We traveled in an old-fashioned one-horse Dearborn wagon.
      I was a boy of twelve years and it was a great occasion for me. At Cincinnati I had
      a fip for a treat, and at that time there was nothing I relished so much as one of
      those big pieces of gingerbread that were served as refreshment on muster days,
      Fourth of July and other gala occasions, in connection with cider. I went into a
      baker's shop and asked for "a fip's worth of gingerbread." The man said, "I guess
      you want hoosier-bait," and when he produced it I found that he had the right idea.
      That was the first time I ever heard the word "hoosier," but in a few years it
      became quite commonly applied to Indiana people. The gingerbread referred to was
      cooked in square pans&mdash;about fifteen inches across, I should think&mdash;and
      with furrows marked across the top, dividing it into quarter-sections. A
      quarter-section sold for a fip, which was 6-1/4 cents. It is an odd fact that when
      Hosier J. Durbin joined the Indiana Methodist Conference, in 1835, his name was
      misspelled "Hoosier" in the minutes, and was so printed. The word "Hoosier" always
      had the sense of roughness or uncouthness in its early use.</p>

    <p>At the time this statement was made, neither Mr. Goodwin nor I knew of the
    existence of the last four lines of Finley's poem, in which this same term
    "hoosier-bait" occurs, they being omitted in all the ordinary forms of the poem. The
    derivation of this term is obvious, whether "bait" be taken in its sense of a lure or
    its sense of food. It was simply something that "hoosiers" were fond of, and its
    application was natural at a time when the ideal of happiness was "a country-boy with
    a hunk of gingerbread."</p>

    <p>After the word had been applied to Indiana, and had entered on its double-sense
    stage, writers who were familiar with both uses distinguished between them by making
    it a proper noun when Indiana was referred to. An illustration of this is seen in the
    writings of J. S. Robb, author of "The Swamp Doctor in the Southwest" and other
    humorous sketches, published in 1843. He refers to Indiana as "the Hoosier state,"
    but in a sketch of an eccentric St. Louis character he writes thus:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">One day, opposite the Planter's House, during a military parade, George was
      engaged in selling his edition of the Advocate<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> of Truth, when a tall hoosier, who had
      been gazing at him with astonishment for some time, roared out in an immoderate fit
      of laughter.<br/></p>

      <p>"What do you see so funny in me to laugh at?" inquired George.</p>

      <p>"Why, boss," said the hoosier, "I wur jest a thinkin' ef I'd seed you out in the
      woods, with all that har on, they would a been the d&mdash;dest runnin' done by
      this 'coon ever seen in them diggins&mdash;you're ekill to the elephant! and a
      leetle the haryest small man I've seen scart up lately."</p>


    <p>Unfortunately, however, not many writers were familiar with the double use of the
    word, and the distinction has gradually died out, while persistent assertions that
    the word was coined to designate Indiana people have loaded on them all the odium for
    the significance that the word has anywhere.</p>

    <p>The real problem of the derivation of the word "hoosier," is not a question of the
    origin of a word formed to designate the State of Indiana and its people, but of the
    origin of a slang term widely in use in the South, signifying an uncouth rustic.
    There seems never to have been any attempt at a rational philological derivation,
    unless we may so account Mr. Charles G. Leland's remarks in Barriere and Leland's
    "Dictonary of Slang, Jargon and Cant," which are as follows:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">Hoosier (American). A nickname given to natives of Indiana. Bartlett cites from
      the Providence journal a story which has the appearance of being an
      after-manufacture to suit the name, deriving hoosier from "husher&mdash;from their
      primary capacity to still their opponents." He also asserts that the Kentuckians
      maintained that the nickname expresses the exclamation of an Indianian when he
      knocks at a door and exclaims "Who's yere?" However, the word originally was not
      hoosier at all, but hoosieroon, or hoosheroon, hoosier being an abbreviation of
      this. I can remember that in 1834, having read of hoosiers, and spoken of them a
      boy from the West corrected me, and said that the word was properly hoosieroon.
      This would indicate a Spanish origin.</p>

    <p>The source of Mr. Leland's error is plain. "Hoosieroon" was undoubtedly coined by
    Mr. Finley to designate a Hoosier child, and what the boy probably told Mr. Leland
    was that the name to apply properly to him would be Hoosieroon. But that alone would
    not dispose wholly of the Spanish suggestion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25"
    id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> for "oon" or "on" is not only a Spanish ending, but
    is a Spanish diminutive indicating blood relation. In reality, however, Mr. Finley
    did not understand Spanish, and the ending was probably suggested to him by quadroon
    and octoron, which, of course, were in general use. There is no Spanish word that
    would give any suggestion of "hoosier." The only other language of continental Europe
    that could be looked to for its origin would be French, but there is no French word
    approaching it except, perhaps, "huche," which means a kneading trough, and there is
    no probability of derivation from that.</p>

    <p>In fact, "hoosier" carries Anglo-Saxon credentials. It is Anglo-Saxon in form and
    Anglo-Saxon in ring. If it came from any foreign language, it has been thoroughly
    anglicized. And in considering its derivation it is to be remembered that the
    Southerners have always had a remarkable faculty for creating new words and modifying
    old ones. Anyone who has noted the advent of "snollygoster" in the present
    generation, or has read Longstreet's elucidation of "fescue," "abisselfa," and
    "anpersant"<a name="FNanchor_11_1" id="FNanchor_11_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1"
    class="fnanchor"><sup>[11]</sup></a> will readily concede that. And in this
    connection it is to be observed that the word "yahoo" has long been in use in
    Southern slang, in almost exactly the same sense as "hoosier," and the latter word
    may possibly have developed from its last syllable. We have a very common slang word
    in the North&mdash;"yap"&mdash;with the same signification, which may have come from
    the same source, though more probably from the provincial English "yap," to yelp or
    bark. "Yahoo" is commonly said to have been coined by Swift, but there is a
    possibility that it was in slang use in his day.</p>

    <p>It is very probable that the chief cause of the absence of conjectures of the
    derivation of "Hoosier" from an English stem was the lack in our dictionaries of any
    word from which it could be supposed to come, and it is a singular fact that in our
    latest dictionaries&mdash;the Standard and the Century&mdash;there<span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> appears the word "hoose,"
    which has been in use for centuries in England. It is used now to denote a disease
    common to calves, similar to the gapes in chickens, caused by the lodgement of worms
    in the throat. The symptons of this disease include staring eyes, rough coat with
    hair turned backward, and hoarse wheezing. So forlorn an aspect might readily suggest
    giving the name "hooser" or "hoosier" to an uncouth, rough-looking person. In this
    country, for some reason, this disease has been known only by the name of the worm
    that causes it&mdash;"strongylus micrurus"&mdash;it sounds very much like "strangle
    us marcus" as the veterinarians pronounce it&mdash;but in England "hoose" is the
    common name. This word is from a very strong old stem. Halliwell, in his "Dictionary
    of Archaic and Provincial Words," gives "hooze" and "hoors," and states that "hoos"
    occurs in the "Promptorium Parvulorum," and "hoozy" in the "Cornwall Glossary," the
    latter being used also in Devonshire. Palmer, in his "Folk-Etymology," says that
    "hoarst&mdash;a Lincolnshire word for a cold on the chest, as if that which makes one
    hoarse," is a corruption of the Old English "host," a cough, Danish "hoste," Dutch
    "hoeste," Anglo-Saxon "hweost," a wheeziness; and refers to Old English "hoose," to
    cough, and Cleveland "hooze," to wheeze. Descriptions of the effect of hoose on the
    appearance of animals will be found in Armatage's "Cattle Doctor," and in the
    "Transactions of the Highland Society of Scotland," fourth series, Vol. 10, at page
    206.</p>

    <p>There is also a possibility of a geographical origin for the word, for there is a
    coast parish of Cheshire, England, about seven miles west of Liverpool, named Hoose.
    The name probably refers to the cliffs in the vicinity, for "hoo," which occurs both
    in composition and independently in old English names of places, is a Saxon word
    signifying high. However, this is an obscure parish, and no especial peculiarity
    of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> the people
    is known that would probably give rise to a distinctive name for them.</p>

    <p>There is one other possibility that is worthy of mention&mdash;that the word may
    come to us through England from the Hindoo. In India there is in general use a word
    commonly written "huzur," which is a respectful form of address to persons of rank or
    superiority. In "The Potter's Thumb" Mrs. Steel writes it "hoozur." Akin to it is
    "housha," the title of a village authority in Bengal. It may seem impossible that
    "hoosier" could come from so far off a source, and get it is almost certain that our
    slang word "fakir," and its derivative verb "fake," came from the Hindoo through
    England, whither for many years people of all classes have been returning from Indian
    service. It is even more certain that the word "khaki" was introduced from India, and
    passed into general use in English and American nurseries long before khaki-cloth was
    known to us.</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, words pass from one language to another in slang very
    readily. For example, throughout England and America a kidnapper is said in thieves'
    slang to be "on the kinchin lay," and it can scarcely be questioned that this word is
    direct from the German "kindchen." The change in meaning from "huzur" to "hoosier"
    would be explicable by the outlandish dress and looks of the Indian grandees from a
    native English standpoint, and one might naturally say of an uncouth person, "He
    looks like a huzur."</p>

    <p>It is not my purpose to urge that any one of these suggested possibilities of
    derivation is preferable to the other, or to assert that there may not be other and
    more rational ones. It is sufficient to have pointed out that there are abundant
    sources from which the word may have been derived. The essential point is that
    Indiana and her people had nothing whatever to do with its origin or its
    signification. It was applied to us in raillery, and our only connection with it is
    that we have meekly borne it for some three score years and<span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> ten, and have made it
    widely recognized as a badge of honor, rather than a term or reproach.</p>
    <hr style="width: 45%;" />

    <p><i>Addendum</i>, February, 1907. The greater part of the preceding was published
    in the Indianapolis News of Aug. 23 and 30, 1902. Afterwards I rewrote and enlarged
    it. Since then there have appeared two publications which threw some additional light
    on the subject. One of these is an account of Col. Lehmanowsky, purporting to be
    autobiographical, published under the title, "Under Two Captains," by Rev. W. A.
    Sadtler, Ph. D., of Philadelphia. This demonstrates that Lehmanowsky believed he
    originated the word, for he gives the following account of it:</p>

      <p class="blockquot">In this connection I may mention an amusing incident that occured somewhat later
      in a town in Kentucky, where I happened for a day or two. There was a drunken brawl
      in progress on the street, and as quite a number were involved in it, the people
      with whom I was speaking began to be alarmed. I remarked just then that a few
      hussars would soon quiet them. My remark was caught up by some bystander, and the
      word hussar construed to mean the men of the State of Indiana (from which I had
      just come), and thus the word "Hoosier" came into existence. Such is the irony of
      fate! Learned men have labored long to introduce some favored word of the most
      approved classic derivation, and as a rule have failed. Here a chance word of mine,
      miscalled by an ignorant loafer, catches the popular fancy and passes into
      Literature.<a name="FNanchor_12_1" id="FNanchor_12_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1"
      class="fnanchor"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

    <p>At the same time he furnishes conclusive evidence that he did not originate it,
    for he says that he did not leave Washington for the West until the spring of 1833;
    that he went as far as Ohio with his family and passed the winter of 1833-4 in the
    state,<a name="FNanchor_13_1" id="FNanchor_13_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_1" class=
    "fnanchor"><sup>[13]</sup></a> reaching Indiana the next spring, or more than a year
    after "The Hoosier's Nest" had appeared in print. His story, as given above, locates
    the incident at a still later date.</p>

    <p>The other publication is the third volume of The English Dialect Dictionary, in
    which appears the following: .<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id=
    "Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

    <p>"<span class="smcap">Hoozer</span>, Cum. 4 (hu-zer) said of anything unusually
    large."</p>

    <p>The "Cum 4" is a reference to "A Glossary of the Words and Phrases pertaining to
    the Dialect of Cumberland;" edition of 1899.</p>

    <p>Although I had long been convinced that "hoosier," or some word closely resembling
    it, must be an old English dialect or slang word, I had never found any trace of a
    similar substantive with this ending until in this publication, and, in my opinion,
    this word "hoozer" is the original form of our "hoosier." It evidently harks back to
    the Anglo-Saxon "hoo" for its derivation. It might naturally signify a hill-dweller
    or highlander as well as something large, but either would easily give rise to the
    derivative idea of uncouthness and rusticity.</p>

    <p>There is a suggestiveness in the fact that it is Cumberland dialect. The very
    center of hoosierdom in the South is the Cumberland Plateau with its associated
    Cumberland Mountains, Cumberland River, Cumberland Gap, and Cumberland
    Presbyterianism. The name Cumberland in these, however, is honorary in origin, the
    river and mountains having been named for that Duke of Cumberland who is known to the
    Scotch as "The Butcher of Culloden." But many of the settlers of this region, or
    their immediate forebears, were from Cumberland county, England, and so "hoozer" was
    a natural importation to the region. Thence it was probably brought to us by their
    migratory descendants, many of whom settled in the upper Whitewater Valley&mdash;the
    home of John Finley.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="giant"><strong>JOHN FINLEY.</strong></span></p>

    <p>For many years Mr. Finley was known as "The Hoosier Poet," an appellation since
    transferred to James Whitcomb Riley, who wrote of him:</p>

      <p class="poem">"The voice that sang the Hoosier's Nest&mdash;<br/>
      Of Western singers first and best&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Readers are always interested in the development of an author. They naturally
    inquire of his ancestry, early environment and education: how much was due to native
    talent, how much acquired by association with kindred spirits.</p>

    <p>Mr. Finley's ancestors were Scotch-Irish Presbyterians; the family was driven from
    Scotland to Ireland by religious persecution, and failing to find the religious and
    political freedom they sought the seven brothers emigrated to America, in 1724.
    Samuel Finley became president of Princeton College; John explored the western wilds
    with Daniel Boone, and the youngest brother, William, settled on a farm in Western
    Pennsylvania. His son, Andrew, married and removed to Brownsburg, Rockridge county,
    Virginia, where John Finley was born, January 11, 1797.</p>

    <p>Andrew Finley was a merchant in the village, but the family occupied a farm in a
    beautiful valley near the Blue Ridge Mountains. This mountain range could not fail to
    impress a child of poetic temperament&mdash;the blue haze veiling its summit, the
    drifting clouds that clung to its side, the rising sun dispersing the mists in the
    valley, or, the shadows creeping over valley and mountain as the setting sun
    disappeared beyond the western horizon, all left lasting pictures in his memory and
    influenced his after life.</p>

    <p>His school days were cut short by his father's financial reverses, following the
    capture of a cargo of flour by the British during the war of 1812. This misfortune
    threw the boy of sixteen on his own resources, and, as nothing better
    offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> he
    accepted a position with a relative who was conducting a tanning and currying
    business in Greenbrier county. This was a most humiliating alternative for a young
    Virginian whose surroundings led him to look upon manual labor as only fit for
    slaves, but it was part of the discipline of life which resulted in marked regard for
    all practical workmen, and an abhorence of the institution of slavery.</p>

    <p>In 1816 he joined an emigrant company and with fifty dollars in his pocket, a
    saddle-horse and rifle and a pair of saddle-bags, turned his face towards the
    "Eldorado of the West." His first stopping place was Cincinnati, Ohio, but in 1820,
    we find him in Richmond, Ind., where he lived to see a small village develop into a
    thriving city.</p>

    <p>Taking an active part in its growth, he was rewarded by the confidence and esteem
    of his fellow citizens who elected him to various offices of trust and
    responsibility. His official career began in 1822, as Justice of the Peace. He
    represented Wayne county in the Legislature, 1828-31, and then was Enrolling Clerk of
    the Senate for three years. During this time he met the leading men of the State and
    formed many lasting friendships. 1833-37, he edited and held a controlling interest
    in the principal newspaper of the county, the Richmond Palladium, and in 1837, was
    elected clerk of the Wayne County Courts, with a term of seven years; this
    necessitated a removal to the county seat, Centerville, but on the expiration of the
    terns (1845) he returned to Richmond, having always considered it his home. Elected
    mayor of the city in the spring of 1852, he retained the office, by re-election,
    until his death, December 23, 1866, having almost continuous public service for more
    than forty years.</p>

    <p>He was a man of sterling integrity; none who knew him ever doubted his word; an
    oath could not make it more binding. As a member of the Masonic fraternity he was
    active in the relief of the poor and needy; his sympathy and assistance were freely
    given to the ignorant negroes seeking refuge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33"
    id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> in Indiana: he looked upon them as children that had
    been deprived of their birthright.</p>

    <p>A self-educated man, his reading covered a wide field; he was familiar with
    standard English authors and was a constant reader of the best current periodicals
    and newspapers, especially those containing the opinions of leading statesmen on
    political questions and internal improvements.</p>

    <p>He was twice married, and had six children, one son, Maj. John H. Finley, gave his
    life for his country in the war for the Union&mdash;from this blow the father never
    recovered. A widow and three daughters survived him. Robert Burns was his favorite
    poet, the humor convulsed him with silent laughter, and "Highland Mary," or "The
    Cotter's Saturday Night" brought the quick tears to his eyes.</p>

    <p>Mr. Finley's reputation as a poet was established when the Indiana Journal
    published "The Hoosier's Nest," January 1, 1833. It was the first "Carrier's Address"
    written by the author, and was followed by an "address" to the Journal for eight or
    nine years in succession. The Palladium also had an annual "address." These were
    rhyming reviews of State and National questions or humorous references to
    peculiarities of candidates for public office. They were of local interest but did
    not arrest general attention as the graphic description of Hoosier life had done.
    After a lapse of seventy-five years "The Hoosier's Nest" is still in demand at Old
    Settlers' Picnics, and at the reunions of the many "Hoosier Clubs" springing up
    wherever Indiana's sons have become prominent in the Great West. The following
    extract is conceded to be the best description of pioneer life to be found in
    print:</p>

      <p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I'm told in riding somewhere West</span><br/>
      A stranger found a <i>Hoosier's Nest</i>&mdash;<br/>
      In other words a Buckeye cabin,<br/>
      Just big enough to hold Queen <i>Mab</i> in;<br/>
      Its situation, low but airy,<br/>
      Was on the borders of a prairie;<br/>
      And fearing he might be benighted,<br/>
      He hailed the house, and then alighted.<br/>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><span style=
      "margin-left: 1em;">The Hoosier met him at the door&mdash;</span><br/>
      Their salutations soon were o'er.<br/>
      He took the stranger's horse aside,<br/>
      And to a sturdy sapling tied;<br/>
      Then having stripped the saddle off,<br/>
      He fed him in a sugar trough.<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The stranger stooped to enter
      in&mdash;</span><br/>
      The entrance closing with a pin<br />
      And manifested strong desire<br />
      To seat him by the log-heap fire,<br/>
      Where half a dozen <i>Hoosieroons</i>,<br/>
      With mush and milk, tin cups and spoons,<br/>
      White heads, bare feet, and dirty faces,<br/>
      Seemed much inclined to keep their places,<br/>
      But Madame, anxious to display<br />
      Her rough but undisputed sway,<br/>
      Her offsprings to the ladder led,<br/>
      And cuffed the youngsters up to bed.<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Invited shortly to partake</span><br/>
      Of venison, milk, and <i>johnny cake</i>,<br/>
      The stranger made a hearty meal,<br/>
      And glances round the room would steal.<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">One side was lined with divers'
      garments,</span><br/>
      The other spread with skins of <i>varmints</i>;<br/>
      Dried pumpkins overhead were strung,<br/>
      Where venison hams in plenty hung;<br/>
      Two rifles placed above the door;<br/>
      Three dogs lay stretched upon the floor&mdash;<br/>
      In short, the domicile was rife<br />
      With specimens of Hoosier life."<br/></p>

    <p>The word <i>Hoosieroon</i> was coined for the poem, and "<i>Hoosier</i>" no longer
    designated a rough, uncouth backwoodsman but a self-reliant man who was able to
    subdue the wilderness, defend his home, and command the respect of his neighbors:</p>

    <p class="poem">"He is, (and not the little-great)<br/>
      The bone and sinew of the State."<br/></p>


    <p>"Bachelor's Hall" was published anonymously, and was immediately credited to the
    Irish poet, Thomas Moore; it was reproduced in England and Ireland many times before
    the authorship was established. It was set to music for "Miss Leslie's Magazine," and
    was sung at a banquet given for the members of the Indiana Legislature:</p>

      <p class="poem">"Bachelor's Hall! What a quare-looking place it is!<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Kape me from sich all the days of my
      life!</span><br/>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>Sure, but I
      think what a burnin' disgrace it is,<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Niver at all to be gettin' a wife.</span><br/>
      See the ould bachelor, gloomy and sad enough,<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Placing his tay-kittle over the fire;</span><br/>
      Soon it tips over&mdash;St. Patrick! he's mad enough<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">(If he were present) to fight with the
      Squire.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      Pots, dishes, pans, and sich grasy commodities,<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ashes and praty-skins kiver the floor;</span><br/>
      His cupboard's a storehouse of comical oddities,<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Things that had niver been neighbors
      before.</span><br/>
      Late in the night then he goes to bed shiverin';<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Niver the bit is the bed made at all;</span><br/>
      He crapes like a terrapin under the kiverin':<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bad luck to the picture of Bachelor's
      Hall!"</span><br/></p>

    <p>His poem entitled, Our Home's Fireside, expresses his appreciation of domestic
    life. He felt that the homes of a country are the fountain of all true happiness, and
    the bulwark of civil and religious liberty:</p>

      <p class="poem">"There's not a place on earth so dear<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">As our Home's Fireside,</span><br/>
      When parents, children all draw near<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">To our Home's Fireside;</span><br/>
      When the toil-spent day is past,<br/>
      And loud roars the wintry blast,<br/>
      Then how sweet to get at last<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">By our Home's Fireside!</span><br/>
      <br/>
      'Tis wedded love's peculiar seat,<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">At our Home's Fireside,</span><br/>
      Where happiness and virtue meet<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">At our Home's Fireside;</span><br/>
      When each prattler, loth to miss,<br/>
      Climbs to claim the wonted kiss,<br/>
      'Tis the sum of human bliss,<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">At our Home's Fireside."</span><br/></p>

    <p>He was ambitious to write a National Hymn which should voice the patriotism of the
    people, but this wish was never gratified. The "Ode for the Fourth of July" was an
    effort in that direction&mdash;constant attention to business prevented the
    cultivation of his poetical talent:</p>

     <p class="center"><span class="big">"ODE FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY."</span><br/>
    Tune&mdash;"Hail to the Chief."</p>

      <p class="poem">Hail to the day that gave birth to a nation!<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hail each remembrance it annu'lly
      brings!</span><br/>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>Hail
      Independence! Thy stern declaration<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gave Freedom a home in defiance of
      Kings.</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Britain's despotic sway</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Trammeled thy early day.</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Infant America, "child of the skies."</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Till with a daring hand</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Freedom's immortal band</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Severed thy shakles and bid thee
      arise!</span><br/>
      <br/>
      Then was the standard of Liberty planted&mdash;<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The star-spangled banner proud floated on
      high;</span><br/>
      Columbia's sons met the foeman undaunted,<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With firm resolution to conquer or
      die.</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Precious the prize they sought,</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Dearly that prize they bought:</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Freedom and peace cost the blood of the
      brave.</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Heaven befriended them,</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Fortune attended them&mdash;</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Liberty triumphed o'er tyranny's
      grave!</span><br/>
      <br/>
      Peace to those patriots, heroes, and sages,<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose glorious legacy now we enjoy!</span><br/>
      May it descend to the world's latest ages,<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like primitive gold, without any
      alloy!</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Then let our motto be,</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">"Union and Liberty,"</span><br/>
      High on our national banner enshrined,<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Like a bright morning star,</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Glittering from afar,</span><br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Casting its beams o'er the world of
      mankind.</span><br/></p>

    <p>When urged by friends to make a collection of poems for publication; he found, (in
    1866), that many had been lost beyond recovery, his hope of writing something more
    worthy of preservation made him careless of that which had been published; there is,
    however, considerable variety in the collection, ranging from "grave to gay." These
    are some of the titles; "Lines," written on opening a mound on the bank of Whitewater
    near Richmond, Ind. containing a human skeleton. "What is Life," "What is Faith," "A
    Prayer," "My Loves and Hates." This was the first poem written for publication.
    "Valedictory, on closing my term as Clerk of the Wayne County Courts."</p>

    <p>In lighter vein are, "Advertisment for a Wife," "The Last of the Family," "To My
    Old Coat," and "The Miller."</p>

    <p>Mr. Finley was not a church member but his creed is embraced<span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> in the following
    sentence&mdash;"The Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man."</p>

    <p>An unpublished fragment, found after death in the pocket-book he carried, shows
    his truly devotional spirit:&mdash;</p>

      <p class="poem">"My Heav'nly Father! deign to hear<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The supplications of a child,</span><br/>
      Who would before thy throne appear,<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With spirit meek, and undefiled.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      Let not the vanities of earth<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forbid that I should come to Thee,</span><br/>
      Of such as I, (by Heav'nly birth)<br/>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy Kingdom, Thou hast said, shall
      be."</span></p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>

   <p class="center"><span class="big">TO JOHN FINLEY.</span><br/>

      <p class="poem">"Hail thou poet occidental,<br/>

      Whose true passions sentimental,<br/>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
